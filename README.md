## Basic Components

+ Triangle intersection via extended Moller-trumbore
+ Phong Shading 
+ Reflection + refraction
+ KD tree + SAH
+ Phong interpolation of normals and vertex materials
+ Auto Threading
+ Regular supersampling Antialiasing
+ Cube mapping


## Bells and Whistles

+ Distribution Ray tracing (Modified Path Tracing) + (new shader model (a different set of bells and whistles))
++ Glossy specular
++ noisy reflection
++ scattered transmission
++ Jittered Super Sampling

+ OBJ file loading 
+ Dealt with overlapping objects
+ Cube maps contribute to ambient light

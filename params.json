The first stage actually computes the **photon map** by firing photons from each light source into the scene in much the same way as traditional ray tracing fires rays from the camera into the scene. The photons are stored in some data structure for later aggregation. Effectively, the second pass is a traditional ray tracer where the shading model incorporates cumulative photon intensities in some local neighborhood. \r\n\r\nIn Jensen's original photon mapping method, the photons are stored in a balanced axis aligned KD-tree and keep track of photon intensity, intersection positions, angle of incidence, and other metadata for future aggregation. During the second pass of the algorithm, when a ray intersects an object all photons in a local sphere are aggregated and the radius of the sphere increases until a predefined energy condition is met. Consequently, total number of photons launched into the scene, photon intensities, minimum sphere radius, maximum sphere radius, and minimum total energy are all hyper-parameters to tune.   \r\n\r\n### Our Architecture\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Pretty Pictures\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMichael Bartling (@mbartling), Souparna Purohit (@limac246)\r\n\r\n",
